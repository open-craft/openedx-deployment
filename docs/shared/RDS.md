Test Access
-----------

Once the RDS instance is set up, it should be accessible from the EC2 instance.
Test this by shelling into each EC2 instance and typing the following, using
the RDS endpoint host name:

    telnet xxxxxxxxx.rds.amazonaws.com 3306

Confirm that you see a "Connected to ..." message. Type Ctrl-D to exit the telnet shell.

Modify Security Groups
----------------------

To add a security group to an existing RDS instance:

* Go to the RDS dashboard in the AWS console,
* Select a single RDS instance to modify.
* `Instance Actions -> Modify -> Security Group`: update the allowed list of security groups.
* Click `Continue` and `Modify DB Instance` to save.
